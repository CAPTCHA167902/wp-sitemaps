# Contributing

Thank you for thinking about contributing to the WordPress sitemaps project! Contributions can either be made in the form of code or through input on tickets.
We appreciate all contributions as they help to move the project forward.


## Contributions to Issues

Tickets will often need input from multiple points of view. We invite you to share your POV by adding a comment to the relevent ticket.

If a ticket does not yet exist, you can create a new ticket and add it to the back log, but please do read: https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/06/12/xml-sitemaps-feature-project-proposal/ and double check that what you are proposing is inline with what we are trying to achieve within this project's scope.


### Creating an Issue

- In Github, under 'Issues' click the green 'new issue' button.
- Give the issue a short but meaningful title. For example... [TODO: add example]
- Give us much detail about the issue in the description box
- Give the issue a label. Either:
	- Type: Bug (Something isn't working)
	- Type: Enhancement (Enhancement to an existing feature)
	- Type: Feature (New feature)
	- Type: Spike (Task to better understand a requirement)
	- Type: Task (Specific task that may not be part of a given feature)
- Assign the issue to the `Execution` project

Please don't assign the t-shirt labels to issues or the issues to milestones as those are for internal use to manage workflow.


## Developer Contributions

When contributing through code, each feature should be developed in a seperate branch.

- Create a new branch, forked from `master`.
- Each branch should be prefixed with the issue number, followed by a short-description of the task. For example: Issue 3: Index Sitemap would become `3-index-sitemap`.
- Regurlarly commit your work and push it to your remote branch on Github.


### Submitting Pull Requests ###

Once you are ready to submit your code for review, you need to create a pull request (PR).

- Under 'Pull Requests', click the green 'New pull request' button.
- When comparing changes, ensure that the base is set to `master` and compare is set to your feature branch.
- Give the PR a title. This should be descriptive, summarize what your request is about in 5-10 words at most.
- Add a description, outlining what you have done, and what problem this solves. Include screenshots if possible to help visualize what changes have been introduced, and reference any open
issues if one exists.

When submitting a PR there are some items you should take note of:
- Does the code follow the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/)?
- Did you include unit tests (if applicable)?
- Was your local copy recently pulled from `master`, so it's a clean patch?


The title of the pull request should be descriptive, summarize what your request is about in 5-10 words at most.
For the main body of the pull request, describe what you have done, and what problem this solves.
Include screenshots if possible to help visualize what changes have been introduced, and reference any open
issues if one exists.
